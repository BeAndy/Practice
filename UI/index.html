                Russia's main opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, has been arrested at an anti-corruption protest he
                organised in the capital, Moscow.
                Thousands of people joined rallies nationwide, calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Dmitry
                Medvedev over corruption allegations.
                At least 500 other protesters were detained in the capital and across the country.
                Most of the marches were illegal, organised without official permission.
                Hundreds of other protesters have been detained across the country, activists say.
                TV pictures showed demonstrators chanting "Down with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin!", "Russia
                without Putin!" and "Putin is a thief!".
                Correspondents say the marches appear to be the biggest since anti-government demonstrations in
                2011/2012.
                Russia's vociferous opposition leader
                Navalny vows to continue fight
                Alexei Navalny was detained as he arrived to join the rally in central Moscow. Protesters then tried to
                prevent a police van from taking him away.
                In a tweet after his detention, he urged fellow protesters to continue with the demonstration.
                "Guys, I'm fine. No need to fight to get me out. Walk along Tverskaya [Moscow main street]. Our topic of
                the day is the fight against corruption," he said (in Russian).

                Alexei Navalny was taken by police officers during a rally in central Moscow
                He later said police stormed the office of his foundation and detained its staff, who were broadcasting
                the protests live.
                Demonstrations were also held in Saint Petersburg, Vladivostok, Novosibirsk, Tomsk and several other
                cities, where arrests had also been reported.
                Why the protests?
                Alexei Navalny called for the nationwide protests after he published reports claiming that Mr Medvedev
                controlled mansions, yachts and vineyards - a fortune that far outstripped his official salary.
                Mr Medvedev's spokeswoman called the allegations "propagandistic attacks", but the prime minister
                himself has not commented on the claims.
                The reports included the accusation that Mr Medvedev had a special house for a duck on one of his
                properties - and on Sunday, some demonstrators held up images of yellow rubber ducks.
                Others showed up with their faces painted green, a reference to a recent attack in which Mr Navalny was
                hit with green liquid.
                In Moscow, protesters filled Pushkin square and some climbed the monument to poet Alexander Pushkin
                shouting "impeachment". Turnout was estimated to be between 7,000 and 8,000, according to police.
                The police said 500 protesters had been arrested in the capital alone, but a rights group, OVD Info, put
                that number at at least 700.
                The Kremlin has not commented on the demonstrations. It had said on Friday that plans for an
                unauthorised protest in central Moscow were an illegal provocation.

                Police were out in large numbers in many Russian cities
                State TV channels did not cover the demonstrations.
                Local media reports suggested the authorities pressured students not to attend. In some cities, exams
                were scheduled on Sunday.
                Alexei Navalny announced his intention to run for president in 2018 against Vladimir Putin. But he is
                barred from doing so after being found guilty in a case he said was politicised.
                He said on his website that protests were planned in 99 cities, but that in 72 of them authorities did
                not give permission.
